## Parallax Effect

The CipherNet website utilizes a parallax effect on the homepage to create an illusion of depth and movement. This effect is achieved by having multiple layers of content scroll at different speeds, creating a 3D-like effect.

## Morse Code

One of the interactive examples on the CipherNet website is the Morse Code encoder and decoder. Users can input text and see it translated into Morse Code, or input Morse Code and see it translated back into text.
